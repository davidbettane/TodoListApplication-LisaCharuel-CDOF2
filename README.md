## **A console based application to help keep track of tasks. You should be able to add, delete, complete tasks.**

In today’s fast-paced world, staying organized is crucial to manage our tasks and responsibilities effectively. A To-Do List App can be an invaluable tool for keeping track of everything you need to accomplish. In this blog post, we’ll guide you through the process of creating a simple To-Do List App using Python.


### **Description of the project**

The project aims to allow the user to enter a specific task in their "To do List" window, to be able to add and delete it, and to also be able to delete all tasks with the "Delete all" button. . Finally the user must be able to exit the window. 

### **Prerequisites**

Before we dive into the coding part, make sure you have Python installed on your system. You should use Visual Studio to implement or contribute to the project.

### **Designing the User Interface**

For this To-Do List App, we’ll be using the tkinter library to create the graphical user interface. The app will have a simple window with an input field for adding tasks and a list to display them. We have created a file named TodoList.py in our project folder and start building the interface.

### **Running the App**

Save the TodoList.py file and run it using your terminal, or using the run icon in Visual Studio Code.
A simple window should appear with an input field and four buttons. Enter tasks into the input field and click the “Add Task” button to populate the list. Your basic To-Do List App is now up and running! You can then add other tasks, delete them if you want to or if they have been completed, and finally you can exit the interface.
